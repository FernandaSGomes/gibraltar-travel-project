          <h2>Why Gibraltar ?</h2>
          <h3>Gibraltar the Mount of Tariq</h3>
          <p>
            The name Gibraltar originates from the Arabic toponym jabal al-Tariq
            (Ô∫®Ô∫íÔªùÔªÑÔ∫≠Ôªï) which means "mountain of T√°rique". The mountain, a
            militarily strategic promontory at the entrance to the Mediterranean
            Sea, guards the oceanic strait that separates Africa from the
            European continent. The name is a tribute to the Berber general
            T√°rique who landed there in 711, beginning the conquest of the
            Visigothic Kingdom. Before it was called by the Phoenicians Calpe,
            one of the Pillars of Hercules. Popularly, Gibraltar is called "Gib"
            or "The Rock".
          </p>
          <p>
            Mons Calpe was considered by the ancient Greeks and Romans as one of
            the Pillars of Hercules, after the Greek legend of the creation of
            the Strait of Gibraltar by Heracles. There is no known
            archaeological evidence of permanent settlements from the ancient
            period. They settled at the head of the bay in what is today known
            as the Campo (hinterland) of Gibraltar. The town of Carteia, near
            the location of the modern Spanish town of San Roque, was founded by
            the Phoenicians around 950 BC on the site of an early settlement of
            the native Turdetani people.
