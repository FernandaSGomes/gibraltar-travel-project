            <h2>Why Gibraltar ?</h2>
            <h3>Gibraltar the Mount of Tariq</h3>
            <p>
              The name Gibraltar originates from the Arabic toponym jabal
              al-Tariq (Ô∫®Ô∫íÔªùÔªÑÔ∫≠Ôªï) which means "mountain of T√°rique". The mountain,
              a militarily strategic promontory at the entrance to the
              Mediterranean Sea, guards the oceanic strait that separates Africa
              from the European continent. The name is a tribute to the Berber
              general T√°rique who landed there in 711, beginning the conquest of
              the Visigothic Kingdom. Before it was called by the Phoenicians
              Calpe, one of the Pillars of Hercules. Popularly, Gibraltar is
              called "Gib" or "The Rock".
            </p>
            <p>
              Mons Calpe was considered by the ancient Greeks and Romans as one
              of the Pillars of Hercules, after the Greek legend of the creation
              of the Strait of Gibraltar by Heracles. There is no known
              archaeological evidence of permanent settlements from the ancient
              period. They settled at the head of the bay in what is today known
              as the Campo (hinterland) of Gibraltar. The town of Carteia, near
              the location of the modern Spanish town of San Roque, was founded
              by the Phoenicians around 950 BC on the site of an early
              settlement of the native Turdetani people.
